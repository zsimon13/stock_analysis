# Green Stocks Analysis

## Project Overview
Steve was looking into stocks for his parents to invest in, and asked for my assitance in determining if it was worth it. In order to determine if the investment was worth while, I used the VBA in Microsoft excel to analyze the performance of 12 stocks. Sotcks performance was gauged by the stock's: 
- Daily volume  
- Annual return

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to effeciently analyze multiple stocks using VBA. While my initial code was sufficient to analyze the 12 stocks in question; it became clear that there was room for improvement in code performance, and would *need* to be improved should we scale up and analyze more stocks. In order to maintain efficiency with a larger data set and increase efficiency with the current data set, I would need to refactor the code. This project will determine if refactoring the code achieved this goal.

## Results
### Refactoring the Code
